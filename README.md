# Boats Away

You wake up trapped on a strange island, and must build an army to attack the natives and steal their boat. WASD to move, E to collect nearby objects. Hover over objects for information.

Your goal: Build 5 soldiers and purchase the bridge (hover it). This allows you to take the boat and finally escape.

( Warning: Terrible code. That's the fun of Ludum Dare ;) )
